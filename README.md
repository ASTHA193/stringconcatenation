# stringconcatenation
Concatenation of two strings using array and pointers.
In computer programming and data processing, two or more character strings are sometimes concatenated for the purpose of saving space or so that they can be addressed as a single item. 
for example, "airline" is a concatenation of the words "air" and "line" into a new word.<br/>
