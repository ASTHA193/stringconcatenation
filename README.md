# stringconcatenation
Concatenation of two strings using array and pointers .
In computer programming and data processing , two or more character strings are sometimes concatenated for the purpose of saving space or so that they can be addressed as a single item . 
for example, "airline" is a concatenation of the words "air" and "line" into a new word.<br/>
